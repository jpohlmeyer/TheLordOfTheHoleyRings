# TheLordOfTheHoleyRings

Simple Python3 project to test eyesight and log the results for further processing afterwards.

## Dependencies

This project is developed and tested with ```python 3.8.10```.  
The GUI is constructed using ```tkinter```.

## Usage

```python3 -m rings```

The eyesight test data is logged in the file ```log.csv``` in the working directory.

## TODO

- [x] Show each ring only for a distinct amount of time
- [x] White/Black and Black/White Mode
- [x] Log data
- [ ] Tune sizes of rings, holes, and line width
- [ ] Additional tests with smaller variation in ring radius after initial coarse test
